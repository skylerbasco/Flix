### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
<br>
<br>
Towards the end of Unit 1, I encountered a roadblock when attempting to render the "AlamofireImage" files onto the posterView. It turned out that the posterView's outlet (UIImageView) was not connected to the MovieCell. After reconnecting the posterView correctly, my build finally succeeded. Shoutout to the CodePath Tech Fellows who helped me resolve this issue during the process!
